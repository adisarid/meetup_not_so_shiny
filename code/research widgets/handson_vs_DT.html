<p>The screen compares two methods of rendring tabular data: <strong>DataTable</strong> versus <strong>handsontable</strong>. Some pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li>DataTable is quick with a lot of data, works server or client side, and has tons of great features easily built into it. Its editing capabilities are limited.</li>
<li>rhandsontable is slow but much more flexible in terms of editing values, generating validation rules while editing (like a small list box), checkboxes in TRUE/FALSE columns, and more.</li>
<li>DataTable seems to be more common than rhandsontable (around <strong>630k versus 15k</strong> downloads per month, according to <strong>cranlog</strong> statistics).</li>
