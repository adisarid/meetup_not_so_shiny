<p>Try the following tests on both tables and see what happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit a factor</li>
<li>Edit a numeric (and try to put a non-numeric value)</li>
<li>Change pages in the DataTable versus walking "excel like" in the rhandson table</li>
<li>Search bar in the DataTable (for rhandsontable you need to customize such with further inputs)</li>
<li>Selection of cells/rows</li>
<li>Adding a new row (exists in rhandsontable, but for DT you need to customize with further inputs)</li>
</ul>
<p>When would you use either one?</p>
