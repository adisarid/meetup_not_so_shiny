# Not So Shiny

Things you should consider (not) to do while developing shiny apps. 

A presentation prepared for a meetup about interactive visualizations for R users (October 24th, 2019).

The presentation is in this repo, and also a small demonstration shiny app I prepared. The app has also been deployed at [https://sarid.shinyapps.io/not_so_shiny](https://sarid.shinyapps.io/not_so_shiny).
